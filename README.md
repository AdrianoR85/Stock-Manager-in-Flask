# üõ† Stock Manager in Flask

This repository is for my learning with Flask. I will use the book Flask de A a Z to study, where the author teaches Flask by developing a stock manager. Everything I learn on this path will be added here.

## About the Project
"You will make a product management system. In this system, we will organize categories, users, and roles. You can limit a user to access only the system API or also the admin area, with secure login."

- Migrate

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Done

### config.py
- Created a base configuration class called `Config` with shared attributes.
- Defined specific classes for:
  - Development: `DevelopmentConfig`
  - Testing: `TestingConfig`
  - Production: `ProductionConfig`
- Used class inheritance to avoid code duplication and maintain organized settings.
- Mapped the configurations using the environment variable `FLASK_ENV`.

### app.py
- Retrieved the active configuration object based on the current environment using `config = app_config[app_active]`
- Defined the factory function `create_app(config_name)` to create and configure a Flask application instance dynamically.
- Inside create_app:
  - Created a new Flask app, specifying `'templates'` as the folder for HTML templates.
  - Set the app's secret key from the configuration object `(config.SECRET)`.
  - Loaded the configuration from the configuration class mapped by `config_name` with `app.config.from_object()`.
  - Loaded additional configuration from the config.py file using `app.config.from_pyfile()`.
  - Defined a basic route `'/'` that returns `'Hello, world!'` when accessed.
- Creates the database instance.
- Initializes SQLAlchemy with the app.
- Returned the fully configured Flask application instance from the factory function.

### run.py
- Imported `create_app` and configuration data to set up the app environment.
- Selected the active configuration instance based on the `FLASK_ENV variable`.
- Created the Flask app and stored it inside the configuration object (`config.APP`).
- Started the Flask server using host and port values from the active configuration.

## üîÑ Database Migration Workflow (Flask-Migrate)
Flask-Migrate uses Alembic to handle SQLAlchemy database migrations. Follow the steps below to set up and manage database schema changes.

### ‚úÖ Initial Setup (Only Once)
If this is your first time setting up migrations:

```bash
flask db init
```
This will create a migrations/ directory with the necessary Alembic configuration files.

### üõ† Apply Model Changes
Whenever you make changes to your models (add tables, modify fields, etc.), follow this process:

1. Generate a new migration script:

```bash
  flask db migrate -m "Describe the change, e.g., add user table"
```
2. Apply the migration to the database:

```bash
  flask db upgrade
```
This will apply the changes to your database schema.

### üîÅ Repeat as Needed
Every time you update your models:
- Run `flask db migrate` to create a new migration file
- Then run `flask db upgrade` to apply it

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
Make sure all models are imported before calling `migrate.init_app(app, db)` inside your create_app function.

Example:

```python
  db.init_app(app)
  from model import Role, User, Category, Product  # import models here
  migrate.init_app(app, db)
```
Ensure the `model/ directory has an __init__.py` file so Python recognizes it as a package.
