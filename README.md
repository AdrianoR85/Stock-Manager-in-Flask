This repository is for my learning with Flask. I will use the book Flask de A a Z to study, where the author teaches Flask by developing a stock manager. Everything I learn on this path will be added here.

## About the Project
"You will make a product management system. In this system, we will organize categories, users, and roles. You can limit a user to access only the system API or also the admin area, with secure login."

## üõ†Ô∏è What Was Done

### Config.py
- Created a base configuration class called `Config` with shared attributes.
- Defined specific classes for:
  - Development: `DevelopmentConfig`
  - Testing: `TestingConfig`
  - Production: `ProductionConfig`
- Used class inheritance to avoid code duplication and maintain organized settings.
- Mapped the configurations using the environment variable `FLASK_ENV`.
