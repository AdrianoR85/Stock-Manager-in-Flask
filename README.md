[![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-In%20Progress-yellow)]()

This project is based on the book *"Flask from A to Z ‚Äì Build More Complete Web Applications"*, written by **Tiago Luiz**. The book teaches how to build web applications using **Flask**, a popular Python web framework.

The goal of the book is to help the reader go from basic to advanced levels in web development with Flask. It covers many important topics
The final result is a complete and functional web app, ready for real use. 

The book also shows good practices for writing clean and easy-to-maintain code.
This project follows the book's content, with notes, example code, and some possible changes or improvements.

 ## Required Libraries
- **```pip install Flask```**: A small web framework to build websites and APIs.
- **```pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy```**: A tool to help Python talk to databases using objects
- **```pip install Flask-Admin```**: A tool to create an admin panel for your Flask app
- **```pip install pymysql```**: A library that lets Python connect to a MySQL database.
- **```pip install Flask-Migrate```**: Helps manage changes in the database using Alembic.
- **```pip install passlib```**: A library to hash (encrypt) passwords safely.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps

### Step 1 - Getting Started

- [x] Creating the Structure.
- [x] Install the required libraries.
- [x] Create environments for each phase of the project.
- [x] Create a Flask Application.
- [x] Configure Flask Database (SQL Alchemy).
- [x] Run the Flask Application.

### Step 2 -  Database Setup
#### Models:
- [x] Create User Mode
- [x] Create Role Model
- [x] Create Category Model
- [x] Create Product Model

#### Migrations
- [x] Configuring the migrate.py file
- [x] Initialize Migration System (`flask db init`)
- [x] Generate Migration Script (`flask db migrate -m "Initial models"`)
- [x] Apply Migrations to Database (`flask db upgrade`)

## About flask
Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for Python. It is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with minimal code. Flask is called a "micro" framework because it provides only the essential tools needed for web development, such as routing (handling URLs), request handling, and template rendering. However, it can be extended with additional libraries for more complex features like databases or user authentication.

*Example of a Simple Flask App:*
```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Hello, Flask!"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
```
#### Key Features of Flask:
- *Simple and Flexible* ‚Äì Flask is easy to learn and allows developers to choose how they want to structure their - applications.
- *Built-in Development Server* ‚Äì It comes with a server for testing, making it convenient during development.
- *Routing* ‚Äì You can define different URLs and connect them to Python functions.
- *Templates* ‚Äì Flask supports Jinja2, a powerful template engine to create dynamic HTML pages.
- *Extensible* ‚Äì You can add plugins for databases (like SQLite or PostgreSQL), forms, security, and more. 

-----------------------------------------------
## About SQLAlchemy and Models

**SQLAlchemy** is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

**Models** are Python classes that represent database tables. They define the structure of your data and allow you to interact with the database in an object-oriented way.

#### Key Features of SQLAlchemy
- *ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)* ‚Äì Instead of writing raw SQL, you can work with Python classes and objects.
- *SQL Expression Language* ‚Äì Allows writing SQL queries in a Python-friendly way.
- *Database Agnostic* ‚Äì Works with different database systems (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) without changing much code.
- *Session Management* ‚Äì Helps manage database transactions safely.
- *Integration with Flask* ‚Äì Often used with Flask in web applications (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy).

#### Example
```python
rom flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'  # SQLite database
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define a Model (Python class for a database table)
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'

# Create the database tables
db.create_all()

# Add a new user
new_user = User(username='john', email='john@example.com')
db.session.add(new_user)
db.session.commit()

# Query all users
users = User.query.all()
print(users)  # Output: [<User john>]
```

## üì¶ Database Migrations with Flask-Migrate

A migration is a script that updates the database ‚Äî for example, adding a new table or column. You do not need to delete or recreate the database when your models change. Flask-Migrate helps you create and apply these changes step by step.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to configure Flask-Migrate

#### 1. Install the library
```bash
pip install Flask-Migrate
```
#### 2. Import and initialize in your Flask app (in migrate.py)
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db' # or other database

db = SQLAlchemy(app)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)

from models import *
```
#### 3. Before using the flask command, set the app:

*Linux/macOS:*
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

*Windows:*
```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
#### 4. Create the migration folder
```bash
flask db init
```
#### 4. Create the migration folder
```bash
flask db init
```
#### 5. Create a new migration script
```bash
flask db migrate -m "message"
```
#### 6. Apply the migration to the database
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Migration commands
|  Command                          | Description                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ``flask db init``                 |  Create the migration folder        |
| ``flask db migrate -m "message"`` |	Create a new migration script       | 
| ``flask db upgrade``	            | Apply the migration to the database |
| ``flask db downgrade``	          | Revert the last migration           |
| ``flask db history``	            | Show the history of migrations      |
