This project is based on the book *"Flask from A to Z ‚Äì Build More Complete Web Applications"*, written by **Tiago Luiz**. The book teaches how to build web applications using **Flask**, a popular Python web framework.

The goal of the book is to help the reader go from basic to advanced levels in web development with Flask. It covers many important topics
The final result is a complete and functional web app, ready for real use. 

The book also shows good practices for writing clean and easy-to-maintain code.
This project follows the book's content, with notes, example code, and some possible changes or improvements.

## About flask
Flask is a lightweight and easy-to-use web framework for Python. It is designed to help developers build web applications quickly and with minimal code. Flask is called a "micro" framework because it provides only the essential tools needed for web development, such as routing (handling URLs), request handling, and template rendering. However, it can be extended with additional libraries for more complex features like databases or user authentication.

*Example of a Simple Flask App:*
```python
    from flask import Flask

    app = Flask(__name__)

    @app.route('/')
    def home():
        return "Hello, Flask!"

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        app.run(debug=True)
```
#### Key Features of Flask:
- *Simple and Flexible* ‚Äì Flask is easy to learn and allows developers to choose how they want to structure their - applications.
- *Built-in Development Server* ‚Äì It comes with a server for testing, making it convenient during development.
- *Routing* ‚Äì You can define different URLs and connect them to Python functions.
- *Templates* ‚Äì Flask supports Jinja2, a powerful template engine to create dynamic HTML pages.
- *Extensible* ‚Äì You can add plugins for databases (like SQLite or PostgreSQL), forms, security, and more. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## About SQLAlchemy and Models

**SQLAlchemy** is the Python SQL toolkit and Object Relational Mapper that gives application developers the full power and flexibility of SQL.

**Models** are Python classes that represent database tables. They define the structure of your data and allow you to interact with the database in an object-oriented way.

#### Key Features of SQLAlchemy
- *ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)* ‚Äì Instead of writing raw SQL, you can work with Python classes and objects.
- *SQL Expression Language* ‚Äì Allows writing SQL queries in a Python-friendly way.
- *Database Agnostic* ‚Äì Works with different database systems (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, etc.) without changing much code.
- *Session Management* ‚Äì Helps manage database transactions safely.
- *Integration with Flask* ‚Äì Often used with Flask in web applications (e.g., Flask-SQLAlchemy).

#### Example
```python
rom flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///mydatabase.db'  # SQLite database
db = SQLAlchemy(app)

# Define a Model (Python class for a database table)
class User(db.Model):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(80), unique=True, nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(120), unique=True, nullable=False)

    def __repr__(self):
        return f'<User {self.username}>'

# Create the database tables
db.create_all()

# Add a new user
new_user = User(username='john', email='john@example.com')
db.session.add(new_user)
db.session.commit()

# Query all users
users = User.query.all()
print(users)  # Output: [<User john>]
```

## üì¶ Database Migrations with Flask-Migrate

A migration is a script that updates the database ‚Äî for example, adding a new table or column. You do not need to delete or recreate the database when your models change. Flask-Migrate helps you create and apply these changes step by step.

### ‚öôÔ∏è How to configure Flask-Migrate

#### 1. Install the library
```bash
pip install Flask-Migrate
```
#### 2. Import and initialize in your Flask app (in migrate.py)
```python
from flask import Flask
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
from flask_migrate import Migrate

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///app.db' # or other database

db = SQLAlchemy(app)
migrate = Migrate(app, db)

from models import *
```
#### 3. Before using the flask command, set the app:

*Linux/macOS:*
```bash
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```

*Windows:*
```bash
set FLASK_APP=app.py
```
#### 4. Create the migration folder
```bash
flask db init
```
#### 4. Create the migration folder
```bash
flask db init
```
#### 5. Create a new migration script
```bash
flask db migrate -m "message"
```
#### 6. Apply the migration to the database
```bash
flask db upgrade
```

### Migration commands
|  Command                          | Description                         |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| ``flask db init``                 |  Create the migration folder        |
| ``flask db migrate -m "message"`` |	Create a new migration script       | 
| ``flask db upgrade``	            | Apply the migration to the database |
| ``flask db downgrade``	          | Revert the last migration           |
| ``flask db history``	            | Show the history of migrations      |

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Routes
In Flask, routes are the URLs that users or applications use to interact with your web application. A route tells Flask what to do when a specific URL is accessed.

### How Routes Work
1. Routing is based on URL patterns.
You define a route using a decorator like ``@app.route('/example')``.
2. Each route is connected to a function, called a view function, that returns a response (usually HTML or JSON).
3. When someone accesses the route URL, Flask runs the corresponding function and returns the result.

### Simple Example
```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return 'Welcome to the homepage!'

@app.route('/about')
def about():
    return 'About this application.'
```
Here:
- Accessing / ‚Üí runs home() and returns Welcome to the homepage!
- Accessing /about ‚Üí runs about() and returns About this application.

### Route + HTTP Method Example
```python
@app.route('/products', methods=['POST'])
def create_product():
    return 'Product created!'
```
Here:
- The route ``/products`` only accepts ``POST`` requests.
- If a user sends a GET request to ``/products``, it will return an error (``405 Method Not Allowed``).

###  Dynamic Route
A dynamic route is a route that accepts variable parts in the URL, allowing you to respond based on user input directly from the path.

Examples:
```python
@app.route('/user/<username>')
def show_user_profile(username):
    return f'Profile page for {username}'

@app.route('/product/<int:product_id>')
def show_product(product_id):
    return f'Displaying product #{product_id}'
```
Here:
- When you access ``/user/lara``, the function receives ``lara`` as the ``username`` argument.
- Flask extracts the value from the URL and passes it to your function automatically.
- Accessing /product/42 will call show_product(42)
- You can also specify types:
    - ``<string:username>`` (default)
    - ``<int:id>``
    - ``<float:price>``
    - ``<path:filepath>`` (accepts slashes /)
    - ``<uuid:uid>``

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Controllers
A controller is a piece of code that receives a request (like when someone clicks a button or opens a page), decides what to do, and sends back a response.

Think of it like a waiter in a restaurant:
- üçΩÔ∏è The customer (user) tells the waiter (controller) what they want.
- üßë‚Äçüç≥ The waiter goes to the kitchen (the database or business logic).
- üßæ Then the waiter brings the food (the response) back to the customer.

### In Web Apps (like Flask, Express, etc.)
- A controller usually handles things like:
- Checking if the request is valid (did the user send all the required info?)
- Calling the right function or talking to the database
- Returning a result (like a message, a webpage, or data in JSON)
